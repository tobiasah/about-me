# Programming Skills

Coming from the world of electrical engineering, I have strong knowledge of low-level programming and signal processing. Over the years, I found my true passion in coding and expanded my horizon ever since.

Even though I consider my journey just begun, I have already used and learned so many tools and languages that it would be dull to just list them all. I therefore have decided to filter out the essential parts.

## Things On My Bucket List

:simple-elixir: deep dive into Elixir ... I love functional programming

:material-language-rust: [egui](https://www.egui.rs/#demo) GUI library written in Rust :exploding_head: ... 

## Daily Friends

These tools and languages I currently use daily within my job.

| Language/Tool | Skill level | ... |
| - | - | - |
| :material-language-python: Python | :material-tally-mark-5: Expert | Used for basically everything. From scripting and data processing to creating handy bindings to binary libraries.|
| :material-language-cpp: | :material-tally-mark-4: Proficient | The language I learned programming on and choosen by my company to do the heavy lifting part. |
| :material-language-markdown: Markdown | :material-tally-mark-5: Expert | Used for __every__ documentation stuff (including private nodes). |
| :material-git: Git | :material-tally-mark-4: Proficient | Lifesaver, gamechanger ... you name it. |
| :material-gitlab: :simple-github: :simple-jenkins: CI/CD | :material-tally-mark-4: Proficient | Automated testing and deployment makes life so much easier |
| :material-linux: Linux | :material-tally-mark-3: Competent | Although linux is my preferred and daily used os I am frequently reminded that there is so much more to learn about it. |

## Nightly Affairs

Whenever I have a quiet evening, which, frankly speaking, does not happen often these with a small child, I sit on the couch and learn more about the following things.

| Language/Tool | Skill level |
| - | - |
| :simple-elixir: Elixir | :material-tally-mark-2: Beginner |
| :material-language-rust: Rust | :material-tally-mark-2: Beginner |
