My name is Tobias Ahrens, I am a :octicons-code-review-16: by :heart: based in :flag_ch: :cow::chocolate_bar:.

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer for [Zurich Instruments](https://www.zhinst.com/ch/en) designing and implementing the best APIs for-high performance Measurement devices.

Aside from my job, I like to explore and contribute to new open-source idea.
